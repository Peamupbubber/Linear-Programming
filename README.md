# Linear Programming

1. Read in from text file the linear program's variables, objective function, and constraints
2. Create a standard form LP out of this inforamtion
3. Put the standard form LP into a tableau
4. Attempt to put the tableau into canonical form (implement Method of Artificial Variables and Subproblem Technique)
5. Return infeasible if so
6. Solve for a single optimal solution (using simplex algorithm as well as revised simplex algorithm, and smallest index rule)
7. Solve for multiple optimal solutions and optimal rays
8. Give optimal set
